# unity-object-pooler

This project was simply designed to make object pooling in my personal projects easier.  While this pooler is not ideal for all projects, it fits the style of game I like creating in Unity very well.

Feel free to clone the repo and use it in your projects.

I'll write an actual guide to it eventually, however the code is well documented and should be fairly easy to figure out.
